I am someone who likes to explore and try new games. There has been so much talk for a game called Escape From Tarkov so I wanted to check it out. Just like any other game there is some learning but because the game is marketed as a first person shooter, that has looting gameplay and teamplay, I was in. Me and a couple of friends started to play the game and found out how hyper realistic the game wanted to be in the combat and weapon systems on the game.
Part of the issue with the game is that upon start up it gives the user very clear actions, pick a face and a voice then it does something that is somewhat important to the overall gameplay. The game has you select to be a bear or a usec. This is something that is not really explained beyond the start up gear is different. And then there you are on the main menu.
