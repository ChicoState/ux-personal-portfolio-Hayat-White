I am someone who likes to explore and try new games. There has been so much talk for a game called Escape From Tarkov so I wanted to check it out. Just like any other game there is some learning but because the game is marketed as a first person shooter, that has looting gameplay, I was in. Upon starting and playing the game, I found out how hyper realistic the environment and gamepaly wanted to be.
Part of the issue with the game is that upon start up it gives the user very clear actions, pick a face and a voice then it does something that is somewhat important to the overall gameplay. The game has you select to be a bear or a usec. This is something that is not really explained beyond the start up gear is different. And then there you are on the main menu.

The main menu demostrates the application of user control and freedom [from the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). The menu allows the player to navigate to many different pages and clearly states a back button on the page. However, the main menu also does not necessarily adhear to the normal Consistency and standards when it comes to starting a match. Attempting the play a match the user might assume to click the Escape From Tarkov button. Doing so gets you to this page:

From here I am given some information on the PMC and SCAV options for playing. The PMC is a choice that lets me use what is on my character. This touches on Recognition rather than recall because I can clearly see a tab labeled character below and the game is telling me that the match will use those items. The SCAV choice clearly states that I get into a match with a random set of gear and tarkov is home which could allude to how NPCs react to me. After selecting an character option the game then wants me to select a loction to escape from. This screen appears as the following:
