I am someone who likes to explore and try new games. There has been so much talk for a game called Escape From Tarkov so I wanted to check it out. Just like any other game there is some learning but because the game is marketed as a first person shooter, that has looting gameplay and teamplay, I was in. Me and a couple of friends started to play the game and found out how hyper realistic the game wanted to be in the combat and weapon systems on the game.
