## A Guidebook into Starting a Match on Tarkov

I am someone who likes to explore and try new games. There has been so much talk for a game called **Escape From Tarkov** so I wanted to check it out. Just like any other game there is some learning but because the game is marketed as a first person shooter that has looting gameplay, I was in. Upon starting and playing the game, I found out how hyper realistic the environment and gameplay wanted to be.
Upon start up, **Escape From Tarkov** gives the player very clear actions, pick a face and a voice then it does something that is somewhat important to the overall gameplay, the game has you select to be a BEAR or a USEC. This is something that is not really explained beyond the start up gear is different. And then there you are on the main menu.

The main menu demonstrates the application of **user control and freedom** [from the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). The menu allows the player to navigate to many different pages and clearly states a back button on the page. However, the main menu also does not necessarily adhere to the normal **Consistency and standards** when it comes to starting a match. The overall system has a great **match between the system and the real world**. The feedback from pressing buttons and changing between pages is very clear but can create confusion when playing. Attempting to play a match I assumed I needed to click the Escape From Tarkov button. Doing so gets you to this page:

From here I am given some information on the PMC and SCAV options for playing. The PMC is a choice that lets me use what is on my character. This touches on **Recognition rather than recall** because I can clearly see a tab labeled character below and the game is telling me that the match will use those items. The SCAV choice clearly states that I get into a match with a random set of gear and tarkov is home which could allude to how NPCs react to me. After selecting a character option, the game then wants me to select a location to escape from. This screen appears as the following:

Looking at the selection location is an intimidating selection. Each map has a description, how long the match lasts for, a difficulty and how many PMCs are allowed in a match. In the center of the screen it asks the player for a time selection. This is assumed to change the visibility on the map. Given that all the maps have a difficulty of insane except for Factory and Woods I decided to play one of those to start. Upon clicking the next button I am greeted with this page:

This page is labeled as practice game mode and has a checkbox in order to start the game in this mode. The game has a bright attention at the bottom stating that the progress does not get saved when in the practice mode. This is great for **Error Prevention** and does not mislead the player into thinking they will make progress when they would not be. After clicking the next button once again I am presented with a page that does not look familiar to anything I have seen in another game. There is a page on insurance:

On this page, I am shown a selection screen to click on items that I have equipped to insure them. This means that if my items are not taken by other users I can get these items back in sometime between 24 to 26 hours later. After insuring some items and clicking next I am taking to another page to finally ready up:

Once I arrived on this page there was little to decide. I could create a group and look for a group. Both options change the start up and would make it possible to have people join me. Neither of these options change or effect clicking ready. The back buttons up to this point do not reset the entire process, but after readying up and clicking back, the entire process is reset.

After this I am in the game with no user HUD (heads up display) just a weapon and no direction other than esacpe. From this point there is gameplay mechanics that lead into more. Just getting into the game there is more menus than I have ever seen. Just the basic getting into a game is somewhat an ordeal and can be intimidating. As far as getting out of a match you must find an exit. This requires an intimate knowledge of the map in a game that does not give the users any maps. This has lead to the creation of user made maps that have loot spot locations, boss spawn locations, spawn locations and exits. This ties into the **doumentation** and makes users accountable for their knowledge of the game. My mental model of the game did not match the conceptual model of the game. This was mainly due to how the game started up and how games typically start.
